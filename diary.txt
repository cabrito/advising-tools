    Going to try localStorage (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2010892/storing-objects-in-html5-localstorage)
    ...and it works!

    Had to change some stuff around... User must now include the full URLs.
    Need to include logic that forces the user to set their preferences in EACH
    script.

    I have finished the user config script. Unfortunately, what I forgot about is that GM.getValue and GM.setValue
    can only share data between instances of the SAME script. So unfortunately, the design of the scripts disallows
    for a simple plug-and-play solution.

    A few options:
        1) Since the preferences menu only matters on Student Planning, I can set a cookie that each of the scripts
           could read. This is the simplest option as the modularity is preserved, and blind changes to Colleague
           won't be necessary.
        2) To make things easier for the advisor, I could have just one, VERY large script. However, this choice
           ruins the modularity and since I don't have access to Colleague, I would have to be very careful with
           any changes I make; any changes would basically be blind.
