    Aha! I can just use @exclude to patch security problems related to things like hardvard.edubadwebsite.com!
    Then just let the user specify the URLs in the user configuration page.

    I'm going to try a one-and-done approach to the URL system. Since Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey permit the user
    to set the includes via their GUI, I think that method is preferred, as it removes one avenue for security holes.

    I'm going to use GM.info.script.includes to grab the URLs. Put in an error if they are not a certain size,
    and search for the URLs that don't have the Student Planner fragment.

    Going to try localStorage (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2010892/storing-objects-in-html5-localstorage)
    ...and it works!

    Had to change some stuff around... User must now include the full URLs.
    Need to include logic that forces the user to set their preferences in EACH
    script.

    I have finished the user config script. Unfortunately, what I forgot about is that GM.getValue and GM.setValue
    can only share data between instances of the SAME script. So unfortunately, the design of the scripts disallows
    for a simple plug-and-play solution.

    A few options:
        1) Since the preferences menu only matters on Student Planning, I can set a cookie that each of the scripts
           could read. This is the simplest option as the modularity is preserved, and blind changes to Colleague
           won't be necessary.
        2) To make things easier for the advisor, I could have just one, VERY large script. However, this choice
           ruins the modularity and since I don't have access to Colleague, I would have to be very careful with
           any changes I make; any changes would basically be blind.
